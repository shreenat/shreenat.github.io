# Introduction
The introduction should motivate your work: what is your topic? What
question(s) are you trying to answer with your analysis? Why is answering those
questions important?

# Data curation. 
Cite the source(s) of your data. Explain what it is. Transform the data
so that it is ready for analysis. For example, set up a database and use SQL to query
for data, or organize a pandas DataFrame.

# Exploratory data analysis. 
(See checkpoint 2.)

# Primary analysis. 
Based on the results of your exploration, choose a machine
learning technique (e.g., classification, regression, clustering, etc.) that will help you
answer the questions you posed in the introduction. Explain your reasoning.

# Visualization. 
Explain the results and insights of your primary analysis with at least
one plot. Make sure that every element of the plots are labeled and explained (don’t
forget to include a legend!).

# Insights and Conclusions
After reading through the project, does an uninformed
reader feel informed about the topic? Would a reader who already knew about the
topic feel like they learned more about it?
If needed, you may add subsections.
